# binary-image-inverter
A simple script which will invert all the bytes of an image.

## Usage
```
git clone https://ABFStudio/binary-image-inverter
cd binary-image-inverter
chmod +x ./binary_inverter.py
./binary_inverter <file-to-invert> <output-file>

If you want to revert the process, you can run the same command and invert files:  
```
./binary_inverter <inverted-file> <original-file>
```

```
sudo cp ./binary-inverter /usr/local/bin
```

__Windows__
Absolutely no idea.
